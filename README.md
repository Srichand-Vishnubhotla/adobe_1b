🎯 Overview
This solution addresses the Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Challenge, creating a smart system that understands not just what information exists in documents, but what matters to specific users based on their role and objectives.

What Makes This Special?
🎭 Persona-Aware: Tailors document analysis to specific user roles and expertise levels
⚡ Fast & Efficient: CPU-optimized processing completing in under 60 seconds
🔄 Versatile: Handles diverse document types from research papers to business reports
📦 Self-Contained: Fully offline Docker solution with no internet dependencies
🎯 Task-Focused: Ranks content based on specific job-to-be-done scenarios
🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Docker installed on your system
PDF documents for analysis
A persona and job description
1. Clone and Build
git clone <repository-url>
cd persona-document-intelligence
docker build -t pdf-intel .
2. Prepare Your Input
Create your persona and job description in persona_job.txt:

Persona: Senior Data Scientist with 5+ years experience in machine learning and statistical analysis. Focused on extracting actionable insights from complex datasets for business decision-making.

Job-to-be-done: Analyze quarterly performance reports to identify key trends and anomalies that could impact strategic planning decisions.
Place your PDF documents in the input/ directory.

3. Run Analysis
Linux/macOS:

docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/input:/app/input" -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" pdf-intel
Windows PowerShell:

docker run --rm -v "${PWD}/input:/app/input" -v "${PWD}/output:/app/output" pdf-intel
4. Review Results
Check the output/ directory for JSON files containing your personalized document insights.

Environment Variables
MAX_SECTIONS_PER_DOC: Maximum sections to extract per document (default: 50)
RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD: Minimum relevance score for inclusion (default: 0.3)
SUMMARY_LENGTH: Target length for refined text (default: 200 words)
Custom Schemas
The system supports custom output schemas by modifying schema/challenge1b_output_schema.json.

🚨 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Problem: Docker build fails with memory error

# Solution: Increase Docker memory allocation
docker system prune -f
Problem: No sections extracted from PDF

# Check if PDF is text-based (not scanned image)
# Ensure PDF is not password-protected
Problem: Low relevance scores across all sections

# Review persona_job.txt for clarity and specificity
# Ensure documents are related to the specified domain
